    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>One of the classics of Chinese cuisine</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Eggs, or as many as you like</li>
        <li>Overnight rice</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Spring onions</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>(Optional) Steam the overnight rice to replenish some water content</li>
        <li>Add vegetable to the wok and heat the wok until moderately hot (before it smokes)</li>
        <li>Throw in the eggs, and quickly stir fry it, be careful not to cook it</li>
        <li>Immediately throw in the rice, and stir fry it with the eggs for some time. (Why egg first? because Egg fried rice means using the egg to fry the rice)</li>
        <li>After some time of frying the rice, add some salt to salten the dish, and soy sauce to make the color slightly darker. Be careful not to oversalt the dish</li>
        <li>Add the spring onions (chopped) at the end of the frying process</li>
