    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A simple and exquisite dish to make at home, especially for cheese lovers.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread slices (You can get it from a loaf of bread, we will use 2 slices for a sandwich)</li>
        <li>Cheese slices (You can buy a whole piece of cheese and grate/slice it on your own)</li>
        <li>Butter (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place two cheese slices in between two bread</li>
        <li>(Optional) Put a small chunk of butter in the pan and turn on low heat</li>
        <li>Put the sandwich in the pan and turn on medium heat</li>
        <li>After a few minutes, flip the sandwich (we want the side that is being heated to be very slightly 'burnt')</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to low heat (the pan should be quite hot now and we want the cheese to melt but not burn the bread)</li>
        <li>After a few minutes, voila, you have a supreme tasty grilled-cheese sandwich!</li>
